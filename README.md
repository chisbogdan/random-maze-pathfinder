# random-maze-pathfinder
Python program which generates a random maze and implements A* for path finding.

Empty tiles are marked with white.
Obstacles are marked with black.

When the maze is drawn on the screen the user has to click on a white tile to set the starting position (the tile will become green).
The next step is selecting the destination (the tile will become red).

The yellow tiles are positions that the algorithm checked in order to find the destination.
The blue tiles mark the path from starting position to destination.

After 10 second a new maze is generated automatically.
